# TA-Lib Everywhere

This project is now **inactive**.  It exists only as a thin shim that
depends on the official [TA-Lib](https://pypi.org/project/TA-Lib/)
Python package.

Installing this package will simply install the upstream
`TA-Lib` distribution:

```bash
pip install ta-lib-everywhere
```

For source code, documentation and issue tracking, please visit the
official TA-Lib project:
