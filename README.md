# TA-Lib Everywhere

This project is now **inactive**.  It exists only as a thin shim that
depends on the official [TA-Lib](https://pypi.org/project/TA-Lib/)
Python package.

Older pre-built wheels have been yanked from PyPI to reduce accidental
installs.  Starting with version 1.0.0, this package acts purely as a
wrapper to install the upstream `TA-Lib` distribution:

```bash
pip install ta-lib-everywhere
```

For source code, documentation and issue tracking, please visit the
official TA-Lib project:

This project follows the same BSD license as the original TA-Lib.
